# LSN_exercises

**************************************************** READ ME ***************************************************


This repository contains the exercises for the Numerical Simulation Laboratory (LSN).


------------------------------------------------ Folders organization ------------------------------------------------

Each folder contains a part of the exercises.


In each folder (except for /11 and /12) there is:

- a jupyter notebook, e.g. LSN_Exercises_01.ipynb, where the exercises are explained and results are shown and discussed;
- C++ source codes for the problems solving, e.g. main.cpp, MolDyn_NVE.cpp, TSP.cpp...;
- header files, e.g. main.h, MolDyn_NVE.h, TSP.h...;
- executable files, e.g. main.exe, MolDyn_NVE.exe, TSP.exe...;
- files for random number generation: random.h, random.cpp, Primes, seed.in;
- a Makefile;
- eventually input files with parameters for the code, e.g. input.dat, config.0...;
- output files with results, e.g. *.out;
- eventually a README.md file that explains how to properly run the code;
- evetually a clean.sh file for cleaning contents;

  Note: programs and results are eventually contained in folders for different parts of the exercises, e.g. /01.1, /01.2 ...
  
  Note: results are eventually stored in folders, e.g. /circle, /square ..., generally named after the type of results they contain;

In folders /11 and /12:
<br/>
- jupyter notebooks where not only the exercises are explained and results are shown and discussed, but also the code is written and executed;
